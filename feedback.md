## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: Fellas, I like the idea of your project and I think if you do this from scratch there's a lot to learn about modeling motion and radiation, so I'm on board with it. If the scope turns out to be too simple, we can add more particles and develop statistics on this project, which is a fine way to make it more complex. I'm hoping to see more details on this come next week, but I think this is the right scale for now and will have some interesting physics along the way.

* Score: 20/20
