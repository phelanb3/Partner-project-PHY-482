## Homework assignment 6

Feedback: Guys, I know you are concerned about how much you have done and if it's enough. Think about this: you have been working on this project for six weeks. You will need to explain the most basic aspects of what you are doing to your classmates. They have not seen any of this. So, to the question that you have asked: I think you have done plenty to present in a poster because you will: (a) need to explain the setup and phenomenon and (b) need to explain how the modeling was done. So, I'd spend this week thinking about if your end goals is the figures that you have, which explain some of the results of your model, how do you get your classmates to understand your work up to that point? What do you need on the psoter to explain synchrotron radiation and how it gets modeled? The additional questions that you have about parameter depdencies or how to make the model better you can muse about in the future work section. You've really done a lot of work to get this where it is and you should be excited to share that with everyone.

## Homework assignment 5

Feedback: Fellas, I am glad to see that you have some plots that demonstrate the model that you are working with. It appears that you have something you feel comfortable with and that you can describe concisely. This is important. One question that came to mind for me and that I think will need to be on the poster is: what is the model you are using. That is, what is the electron doing when you are modeling and it how does that relate to the figures you have produced. You will need a diagram for that model and to explain how the calculations you are doing are related to that specific model. Chris has a good idea in his figure caption discussion about trying to model the electron as it spirals, but I think whatever you end up doing, it will need to be clear how the electron is moving in each model and then what figures are demonstrating. I also want you to think about how you will lay out your poster because you have a lot of figures already to show, so think about what makes sense to prsent conceptually and what people will need to understand before they get to the next figure. Great work!

## Homework assignment 4

Feedback: Fellas, I was glad to see that you are both working on complementary parts of the project. It appears that Chris has hit a snag, so maybe y'all should talk together about it and what you are trying to do. I noticed in Brian's notebook that there was a clearly described rationale (in text) for what he is trying to do, but I wasn't sure what Chris's notebook was supposed to be doing because I would be inferring from the code. We can also chat about what you are both trying to do and make sure that you are doing it in a way that supports the project. I'm happy to do that anytime if it's helpful. In any event, it sound like you need to get your code working to produce some qualitative solutions that make sense and then start putting together a draft of the poster this week.

## Homework assignment 3

Feedback: Fellas, I think what you have here shows me that you have started to develop a connection between the analytical and modeling problem you will have. I think that you might need to appreciate that the questions which you have here are the result of analytical modeling (i.e., some restricted arguments that lead to these equations). If you intend to do part A as you describe, you making a first principles model of radiation, which is fine. You will need to understand for a single particle how to calculate the radiated power in each time step so you can begun to determine how that will work in the undulator. I think if you get the first part of this working this week (i.e., modeling a particle and showing you can get the radiated power), you have will be pretty good and can model a small undulator (here the task will be how to represent the magnetic field). Even if you don't get there, you could model a collection of particles.

## Homework assignment 2

Feedback: Fellas, you've got a solid plan here for this project. I think if you are intersted in modeling motion in a more sophisticated way as part of this project, you will want to look into Runge-Kutta integration methods. You can also start using the integrators that come with scipy (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html) as these ussually faster than what you can write yourself from scratch. As you are modeling multiple particles, it will be important to consider speed of computations. The most important aspect of your modeling is going to be how the particles radiate and what that does to their energy classically because they will need to be modeled to include the EM radiation that you observe. I think spending a bit of time thinking about the relationship between particle motion and radiation is a good idea (A decent start is Griffith's chapter 11).

## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: Fellas, I like the idea of your project and I think if you do this from scratch there's a lot to learn about modeling motion and radiation, so I'm on board with it. If the scope turns out to be too simple, we can add more particles and develop statistics on this project, which is a fine way to make it more complex. I'm hoping to see more details on this come next week, but I think this is the right scale for now and will have some interesting physics along the way.
