## Homework assignment 3

Feedback: Fellas, I think what you have here shows me that you have started to develop a connection between the analytical and modeling problem you will have. I think that you might need to appreciate that the questions which you have here are the result of analytical modeling (i.e., some restricted arguments that lead to these equations). If you intend to do part A as you describe, you making a first principles model of radiation, which is fine. You will need to understand for a single particle how to calculate the radiated power in each time step so you can begun to determine how that will work in the undulator. I think if you get the first part of this working this week (i.e., modeling a particle and showing you can get the radiated power), you have will be pretty good and can model a small undulator (here the task will be how to represent the magnetic field). Even if you don't get there, you could model a collection of particles.

* Score: 20/20

## Homework assignment 2

Feedback: Fellas, you've got a solid plan here for this project. I think if you are intersted in modeling motion in a more sophisticated way as part of this project, you will want to look into Runge-Kutta integration methods. You can also start using the integrators that come with scipy (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html) as these ussually faster than what you can write yourself from scratch. As you are modeling multiple particles, it will be important to consider speed of computations. The most important aspect of your modeling is going to be how the particles radiate and what that does to their energy classically because they will need to be modeled to include the EM radiation that you observe. I think spending a bit of time thinking about the relationship between particle motion and radiation is a good idea (A decent start is Griffith's chapter 11).

* Score: 20/20

## Homework assignment 1

Feedback: Fellas, I like the idea of your project and I think if you do this from scratch there's a lot to learn about modeling motion and radiation, so I'm on board with it. If the scope turns out to be too simple, we can add more particles and develop statistics on this project, which is a fine way to make it more complex. I'm hoping to see more details on this come next week, but I think this is the right scale for now and will have some interesting physics along the way.
